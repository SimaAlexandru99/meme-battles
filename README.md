# 📘 Meme Battles — Project Documentation & Development Plan

**Meme Battles** is a real-time multiplayer web game where players compete to create the funniest meme matches. Inspired by **What Do You Meme?**, players draw seven random meme image cards from a pool of 800 images stored in `/public/memes/`, select one to match an AI-generated situation (using Vercel AI SDK), and rate submissions to determine the winner.

## 🎯 Project Overview

- **Platform**: Web-based, built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **shadcn/ui**, **Firebase**, and **Vercel AI SDK** (`npm i ai`).
- **Core Gameplay**: Players join rooms, receive seven random meme image cards from a folder of 800 images, submit one card to match an AI-generated situation, and rate all submissions (1-5 stars) to score points.
- **Goal**: Launch by **August 25, 2025 @ 10:00 PM**.

## 🎲 Game Mechanics (Inverted from What Do You Meme?)

1. Each player receives **seven random meme image cards** from a pool of 800 images in `/public/memes/`.
2. An **AI-generated situation** (e.g., "When you realize the meeting is all-you-can-eat...") is presented each round using Vercel AI SDK.
3. Players select and submit one meme image card to match the situation.
4. All players rate each submission anonymously using emojis (😂 = 1pt, 😄 = 2pts, 🤣 = 3pts, 🔥 = 4pts, 💯 = 5pts).
5. The card with the highest total emoji points wins the round, and the player earns points based on their submission's total score.
6. Players draw back up to seven cards from the meme pool, and a new round begins.

### Key Features

- **Random Meme Selection**: Randomly assign seven unique meme images per player from 800 images, ensuring no duplicates within a player's hand.
- **AI Situations**: Dynamic, humorous prompts generated via Vercel AI SDK.
- **Rating System**: Democratic scoring with emoji reactions (😂 😄 🤣 🔥 💯) worth 1-5 points each.
- **Social Features**: Real-time chat and shareable winning memes.
- **Visual Polish**: Meme-centric UI with animations and confetti effects.

### 🎯 Emoji Rating System

Players rate submissions using five emoji reactions, each worth different points:

| Emoji | Points | Meaning        |
| ----- | ------ | -------------- |
| 😂    | 1pt    | Slightly funny |
| 😄    | 2pts   | Pretty good    |
| 🤣    | 3pts   | Very funny     |
| 🔥    | 4pts   | Hilarious      |
| 💯    | 5pts   | Perfect match  |

**Scoring Logic:**

- Each player can rate each submission with one emoji
- Total points = sum of all emoji reactions received
- Winner is determined by highest total points
- Players earn points equal to their submission's total score

## 🌟 Stretch Goals

- **AI Caption Suggestions**: Offer AI-generated caption hints for situations.
- **Themed Meme Packs**: Categorize the 800 memes into themes (e.g., pop culture, animals).
- **Custom Memes**: Allow moderated image uploads.
- **Enhanced Emoji Reactions**: Add more reaction options beyond the core 5 emojis.
- **Freestyle Mode**: Players create custom situations.

## 📋 Meme Card Selection Logic

- **Folder**: `/public/memes/` contains 800 images (e.g., `meme001.jpg` to `meme800.jpg`).
- **Distribution**: For each player, randomly select seven unique images without replacement within their hand, but allow overlap across players.
- **Implementation**: Use `memeSelector.ts` to generate a list of image URLs (e.g., `/memes/meme123.jpg`) and store them in Firestore under `players.cards`.
- **Refill**: After each round, replenish each player's hand to seven cards, ensuring no duplicates in their new hand.

### Sample Code for `memeSelector.ts`

```javascript
// /lib/memeSelector.ts
export function getRandomMemeCards(numCards = 7, totalMemes = 800) {
  const memeUrls = [];
  const usedIndices = new Set();

  while (memeUrls.length < numCards) {
    const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * totalMemes) + 1;
    const paddedIndex = String(index).padStart(3, "0");
    const memeUrl = `/memes/meme${paddedIndex}.jpg`;

    if (!usedIndices.has(index)) {
      usedIndices.add(index);
      memeUrls.push(memeUrl);
    }
  }

  return memeUrls;
}

// Usage: Assign to player in Firestore
// const playerCards = getRandomMemeCards(7, 800);
// db.collection('rooms').doc(roomId).update({ [`players.${playerId}.cards`]: playerCards });
```
