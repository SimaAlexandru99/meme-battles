# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements advertisement banners on the left and right sides of the application layout. The banners will display 160x600 pixel advertisements with "Remove Ads" upgrade buttons, positioned as fixed elements that remain visible during scrolling. The implementation will integrate with existing authentication and layout systems while providing a clean, non-intrusive advertising experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see advertisement banners on the sides of the application, so that the platform can generate revenue while I use the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display left and right advertisement banners
2. WHEN the user scrolls the page THEN the banners SHALL remain fixed in position
3. WHEN the banners are displayed THEN they SHALL be 160x600 pixels in size
4. WHEN the banners are rendered THEN they SHALL be positioned at the left and right edges of the viewport

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to remove advertisements, so that I can have an ad-free experience if I choose to upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advertisement banners are displayed THEN each banner SHALL include a "Remove Ads" button
2. WHEN the "Remove Ads" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL redirect to the upgrade page
3. WHEN the button is displayed THEN it SHALL show localized text (e.g., "EliminÄƒ Reclamele" for Romanian)
4. WHEN the button is rendered THEN it SHALL have appropriate styling with gold/premium appearance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the advertisement system to integrate seamlessly with the existing layout, so that it doesn't interfere with the current authentication and setup flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the layout renders THEN the advertisement banners SHALL be added without breaking existing functionality
2. WHEN the AnonymousAuthProvider and FirstTimeSetupProvider are active THEN the banners SHALL still display correctly
3. WHEN the banners are positioned THEN they SHALL not overlap with the main content area
4. WHEN the layout is responsive THEN the banners SHALL adapt appropriately to different screen sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the advertisements to load properly and display relevant content, so that I see functional ads rather than broken placeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL initialize advertisement slots with proper IDs
2. WHEN ads are loaded THEN they SHALL display within the designated 160x600 pixel containers
3. WHEN ad loading fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the layout
4. WHEN multiple ad slots exist THEN each SHALL have unique identifiers to prevent conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the advertisement implementation to follow proper CSS practices, so that the styling is maintainable and doesn't conflict with existing styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS classes are defined THEN they SHALL use the existing naming convention with module-style classes
2. WHEN banner positioning is applied THEN it SHALL use fixed positioning with proper z-index values
3. WHEN banner containers are styled THEN they SHALL include proper flexbox layout for centering
4. WHEN responsive behavior is needed THEN the banners SHALL hide or adapt on smaller screens appropriately
