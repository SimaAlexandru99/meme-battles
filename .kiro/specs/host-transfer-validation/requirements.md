# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Host Transfer Testing & Validation feature ensures that the Meme Battles game maintains seamless continuity when the current host leaves during any phase of gameplay. This system must be thoroughly tested to validate that automatic host transfer works correctly across all game states, maintains game integrity, and provides a smooth experience for remaining players.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player in a game where the host leaves, I want the game to continue seamlessly with a new host, so that my gaming experience is not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current host leaves the lobby THEN the system SHALL automatically select the earliest joined player as the new host
2. WHEN host transfer occurs THEN all players SHALL receive real-time notifications of the new host via Firebase listeners
3. WHEN a new host is selected THEN the game state SHALL remain intact and continue without data loss
4. WHEN host transfer happens during active gameplay THEN timer-based transitions SHALL continue under the new host's control

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new host after the original host leaves, I want to have all host privileges and controls, so that I can manage the game effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I become the new host THEN my isHost flag SHALL be set to true in the database
2. WHEN I become the new host THEN I SHALL have access to all host controls (start game, manage settings, etc.)
3. WHEN I become the new host THEN AI bot management SHALL transfer to me automatically
4. WHEN I become the new host THEN phase transition control SHALL transfer to me seamlessly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the host transfer system to work correctly during critical game moments, so that the game doesn't break or become unplayable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN host leaves during phase transitions THEN the new host SHALL complete the transition correctly
2. WHEN host leaves while AI bots are submitting THEN AI bots SHALL continue their submissions under the new host
3. WHEN host leaves during voting countdown THEN the voting phase SHALL continue and complete properly
4. WHEN host leaves during the final round THEN the game SHALL complete and show final results correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully when multiple players leave or unusual scenarios occur, so that the game remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the host and other players leave simultaneously THEN the system SHALL select a new host from remaining players
2. WHEN the new host leaves immediately after transfer THEN the system SHALL transfer host again to the next earliest player
3. WHEN only AI players remain after host leaves THEN the system SHALL handle the scenario appropriately
4. WHEN only one human player remains after host leaves THEN that player SHALL become the host automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and error tracking for host transfer events, so that I can identify and fix any issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN host transfer occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the transfer process
2. WHEN host transfer fails THEN the system SHALL log error details and attempt recovery
3. WHEN host validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback logic to maintain game continuity
4. WHEN host transfer events occur THEN Sentry SHALL track any errors or unusual patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a QA tester, I want systematic test scenarios for all host transfer situations, so that I can validate the system works correctly in all cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing host transfer THEN test scenarios SHALL cover all game phases (lobby, submission, voting, results)
2. WHEN testing edge cases THEN scenarios SHALL include rapid host changes and multiple simultaneous departures
3. WHEN testing host transfer THEN validation SHALL confirm timer continuity and AI bot participation
4. WHEN testing is complete THEN all critical host transfer scenarios SHALL pass validation
