# Design Document

## Overview

The Host Transfer Testing & Validation system provides a comprehensive framework for testing the robustness of the host transfer mechanism in Meme Battles. This design ensures systematic validation of all host transfer scenarios, edge cases, and critical timing situations to guarantee seamless game continuity.

### Test Environment Setup

The testing system will utilize multiple browser instances or devices to simulate real multiplayer scenarios:

- **Primary Test Instance**: Simulates the original host
- **Secondary Instances**: Simulate other players (2-7 additional players)
- **AI Bot Integration**: Validates AI behavior during host transfers
- **Firebase Monitoring**: Real-time database state observation

## Components and Interfaces

### Test Scenario Manager

```typescript
interface TestScenario {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phase: GamePhase;
  playerCount: number;
  aiCount: number;
  description: string;
  expectedBehavior: string[];
  validationCriteria: ValidationCriteria[];
}

interface ValidationCriteria {
  type: "host_transfer" | "game_continuity" | "timer_sync" | "ai_behavior";
  condition: string;
  expectedValue: any;
  tolerance?: number;
}
```

### Host Transfer Monitor

```typescript
interface HostTransferEvent {
  timestamp: number;
  oldHostUid: string;
  newHostUid: string;
  gamePhase: GamePhase;
  playerCount: number;
  transferDuration: number;
  success: boolean;
  errors?: string[];
}

interface GameStateSnapshot {
  timestamp: number;
  phase: GamePhase;
  hostUid: string;
  players: PlayerData[];
  gameSettings: GameSettings;
  roundData: RoundData;
  timerState: TimerState;
}
```

### Test Execution Engine

```typescript
interface TestExecutor {
  setupTestEnvironment(scenario: TestScenario): Promise<TestEnvironment>;
  executeHostLeave(
    hostUid: string,
    timing: "immediate" | "delayed"
  ): Promise<void>;
  validateHostTransfer(event: HostTransferEvent): ValidationResult;
  captureGameState(): GameStateSnapshot;
  cleanupTest(): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Data Models

### Test Results Schema

```typescript
interface TestResult {
  scenarioId: string;
  executionId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  status: "passed" | "failed" | "warning";
  duration: number;
  hostTransferEvents: HostTransferEvent[];
  gameStateSnapshots: GameStateSnapshot[];
  validationResults: ValidationResult[];
  performanceMetrics: PerformanceMetrics;
  errors: TestError[];
}

interface PerformanceMetrics {
  hostTransferLatency: number;
  gameStateSyncTime: number;
  playerNotificationDelay: number;
  aiResponseTime: number;
}
```

### Critical Test Scenarios

#### Phase-Based Testing

1. **Lobby Phase Host Leave**
   - Host leaves before game starts
   - New host can start game
   - Settings preserved
   - Players remain in lobby

2. **Submission Phase Host Leave**
   - Host leaves during card submission
   - Timer continues under new host
   - AI bots complete submissions
   - Phase transitions correctly

3. **Voting Phase Host Leave**
   - Host leaves during voting
   - Voting continues
   - Results calculated correctly
   - Next round starts properly

4. **Results Phase Host Leave**
   - Host leaves during results display
   - Leaderboard updates correctly
   - Next round preparation works
   - Final round handling

#### Edge Case Testing

1. **Rapid Host Changes**
   - New host leaves immediately
   - Multiple rapid departures
   - Host transfer chain validation

2. **Simultaneous Departures**
   - Host + multiple players leave together
   - Deterministic new host selection
   - Game state consistency

3. **AI-Only Scenarios**
   - Only AI players remain
   - Host assignment to AI
   - Game completion handling

## Error Handling

### Host Transfer Failure Recovery

```typescript
interface HostTransferRecovery {
  detectFailure(): boolean;
  attemptRecovery(): Promise<boolean>;
  fallbackToGamePause(): void;
  notifyPlayers(message: string): void;
}
```

### Validation Failure Handling

- **Soft Failures**: Log warnings but continue test execution
- **Hard Failures**: Stop test and report critical issues
- **Recovery Attempts**: Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative validation methods

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Test Suite

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation
2. **Integration Tests**: Multi-component interaction testing
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete game flow validation
4. **Load Tests**: Multiple concurrent host transfers
5. **Stress Tests**: Rapid succession scenarios

### Manual Testing Protocol

1. **Exploratory Testing**: Unscripted scenario discovery
2. **User Experience Testing**: Player perspective validation
3. **Edge Case Discovery**: Unusual scenario identification
4. **Performance Observation**: Real-time behavior analysis

### Monitoring and Metrics

#### Real-time Monitoring

- Firebase database state changes
- WebSocket connection status
- Player connection states
- Game phase transitions
- Timer synchronization

#### Performance Metrics

- Host transfer latency (target: <500ms)
- Game state sync time (target: <200ms)
- Player notification delay (target: <100ms)
- AI response continuity (target: no interruption)

#### Success Criteria

- 99% host transfer success rate
- <1 second game interruption during transfer
- 100% game state preservation
- 100% AI bot continuity
- Zero data loss during transfers

### Test Data Collection

#### Logging Strategy

```typescript
interface TestLog {
  level: "info" | "warn" | "error";
  timestamp: number;
  component: string;
  event: string;
  data: any;
  scenarioId: string;
}
```

#### Metrics Collection

- Host transfer timing data
- Game state consistency checks
- Player experience metrics
- Error frequency and patterns
- Performance benchmarks

### Reporting and Analysis

#### Test Reports

- Scenario execution summaries
- Pass/fail statistics
- Performance trend analysis
- Error pattern identification
- Recommendation generation

#### Dashboard Visualization

- Real-time test execution status
- Historical performance trends
- Error rate monitoring
- Success rate tracking
- Performance metric visualization
