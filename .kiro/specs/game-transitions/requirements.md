# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The game transitions system ensures smooth, seamless user experience when moving between different states of Meme Battles gameplay. This system handles the critical transitions from lobby creation/joining to active gameplay, managing loading states, error recovery, and maintaining real-time synchronization across all players. The system must provide clear visual feedback, handle network issues gracefully, and ensure no player is left behind during state changes.
