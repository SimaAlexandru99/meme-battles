# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables anonymous guest users to seamlessly upgrade their temporary accounts to permanent accounts while preserving all their data, progress, and preferences. The system should provide multiple upgrade paths (email/password, Google, GitHub) and ensure zero data loss during the transition.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an anonymous guest user, I want to upgrade my account to a permanent account so that I can preserve my progress and access my data across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous user chooses to upgrade their account THEN the system SHALL present upgrade options (email/password, Google, GitHub)
2. WHEN an anonymous user completes the upgrade process THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing user data (XP, profile settings, game history)
3. WHEN an anonymous user upgrades their account THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user ID to preserve data relationships
4. WHEN the upgrade process is completed THEN the system SHALL update the user's authentication provider and remove the anonymous flag
5. WHEN an upgraded user signs in later THEN the system SHALL recognize them as a permanent user with all preserved data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an anonymous user, I want to be prompted to upgrade my account at strategic moments so that I don't lose my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous user reaches significant milestones (e.g., 100 XP, first battle win) THEN the system SHALL show upgrade prompts
2. WHEN an anonymous user's session is about to expire THEN the system SHALL offer account upgrade to prevent data loss
3. WHEN an anonymous user tries to access premium features THEN the system SHALL prompt for account upgrade
4. WHEN showing upgrade prompts THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the benefits of upgrading
5. WHEN a user dismisses an upgrade prompt THEN the system SHALL respect their choice and not show the same prompt again for a reasonable time period

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an anonymous user, I want the upgrade process to be simple and secure so that I can quickly create a permanent account without friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous user starts the upgrade process THEN the system SHALL use Firebase's linkWithCredential functionality
2. WHEN linking with email/password THEN the system SHALL require email verification before completing the upgrade
3. WHEN linking with OAuth providers THEN the system SHALL handle existing account conflicts gracefully
4. WHEN the linking process fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN the upgrade is successful THEN the system SHALL show confirmation and update the UI to reflect permanent account status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity during account upgrades so that no user data is lost or corrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an account upgrade begins THEN the system SHALL create a backup of the current anonymous user data
2. WHEN the Firebase account linking succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the database user record atomically
3. WHEN the database update fails THEN the system SHALL rollback the Firebase linking and restore the anonymous state
4. WHEN an upgrade is completed THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and log the successful transition
5. WHEN multiple upgrade attempts occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions and prevent data corruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can troubleshoot upgrade issues and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any step of the upgrade process fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with user context
2. WHEN account conflicts occur (email already exists) THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for resolution
3. WHEN network issues interrupt the upgrade THEN the system SHALL allow retry mechanisms
4. WHEN the upgrade process times out THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the timeout and preserve anonymous state
5. WHEN upgrade analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL track success rates, failure reasons, and user behavior patterns
