# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements Firebase App Check with reCAPTCHA Enterprise to secure the Meme Battles application against abuse and unauthorized access. App Check will ensure that only legitimate instances of the app can access Firebase resources like Firestore, Authentication, and Cloud Functions. The implementation will use reCAPTCHA Enterprise's invisible score-based verification to provide security without impacting user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to protect Firebase resources from unauthorized access, so that only legitimate app instances can interact with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL configure App Check with reCAPTCHA Enterprise provider
2. WHEN App Check is enabled THEN all Firebase requests SHALL include valid App Check tokens
3. WHEN enforcement is enabled THEN Firebase services SHALL reject requests without valid App Check tokens
4. WHEN App Check tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them without user intervention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure reCAPTCHA Enterprise for App Check, so that the security implementation is invisible to users and doesn't require challenge solving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up reCAPTCHA Enterprise THEN the system SHALL use score-based site keys without checkbox challenges
2. WHEN configuring the site key THEN the system SHALL specify all production and development domains
3. WHEN App Check initializes THEN the system SHALL use the reCAPTCHA Enterprise provider with the correct site key
4. WHEN tokens are generated THEN they SHALL have appropriate TTL settings for security and performance balance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to support development and testing environments, so that App Check doesn't interfere with local development and CI/CD processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL use App Check debug provider
2. WHEN in debug mode THEN the system SHALL generate debug tokens that bypass reCAPTCHA verification
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL automatically select the appropriate provider
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging for App Check token generation and validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor App Check metrics and gradually enable enforcement, so that legitimate users aren't disrupted while suspicious activity is blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN App Check is deployed THEN the system SHALL collect metrics on token validation success/failure rates
2. WHEN monitoring metrics THEN administrators SHALL be able to view App Check request statistics
3. WHEN enforcement is enabled THEN the system SHALL block requests with invalid or missing App Check tokens
4. WHEN enforcement is active THEN legitimate users SHALL continue to access the app without interruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate App Check with existing Firebase services, so that all backend resources are protected consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN App Check is configured THEN it SHALL protect Firestore database operations
2. WHEN App Check is configured THEN it SHALL protect Firebase Authentication requests
3. WHEN App Check is configured THEN it SHALL protect Cloud Functions invocations
4. WHEN App Check tokens are invalid THEN protected services SHALL return appropriate error responses
