# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables lobby hosts to modify game settings in private lobbies before starting the game. The feature builds upon the existing private lobby system and provides an intuitive interface for customizing game parameters such as number of rounds, time limits, and meme categories. Only the host of a private lobby can modify these settings, and changes are immediately reflected to all players in the lobby.
