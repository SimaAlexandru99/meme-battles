# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive testing environment for the Meme Battles Next.js application. The testing setup will support unit testing, integration testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability across the entire application stack including React components, Firebase integration, API routes, and user workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive unit testing framework, so that I can test individual functions, utilities, and components in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the test command THEN the system SHALL execute all unit tests using Jest as the test runner
2. WHEN testing React components THEN the system SHALL use React Testing Library for component rendering and interaction testing
3. WHEN testing TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL provide proper type checking and IntelliSense support in test files
4. WHEN testing utility functions THEN the system SHALL support testing of pure functions in the lib directory
5. IF a test file is created with .test.ts or .spec.ts extension THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and run the test

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test React components with user interactions, so that I can ensure UI components behave correctly under different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing React components THEN the system SHALL render components in a test environment using React Testing Library
2. WHEN simulating user interactions THEN the system SHALL support clicking, typing, and form submissions
3. WHEN testing component state changes THEN the system SHALL verify state updates and re-renders
4. WHEN testing component props THEN the system SHALL validate prop handling and prop-driven behavior
5. IF a component uses hooks THEN the system SHALL support testing custom hooks in isolation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to mock Firebase services during testing, so that tests run independently without requiring actual Firebase connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Firebase authentication THEN the system SHALL provide mocked auth functions and user states
2. WHEN testing Firestore operations THEN the system SHALL mock database read/write operations
3. WHEN testing Firebase admin functions THEN the system SHALL mock server-side Firebase operations
4. IF a test requires Firebase functionality THEN the system SHALL use consistent mock implementations
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL NOT make actual network calls to Firebase services

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test API routes and server-side functionality, so that I can ensure backend logic works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing Next.js API routes THEN the system SHALL support testing HTTP request/response cycles
2. WHEN testing server-side functions THEN the system SHALL mock external dependencies and services
3. WHEN testing authentication middleware THEN the system SHALL simulate authenticated and unauthenticated requests
4. IF an API route uses environment variables THEN the system SHALL provide test-specific configuration
5. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL verify proper error responses and status codes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end testing capabilities, so that I can test complete user workflows and application integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running e2e tests THEN the system SHALL use Playwright to automate browser interactions
2. WHEN testing user workflows THEN the system SHALL support multi-step user journeys
3. WHEN testing across browsers THEN the system SHALL run tests on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
4. IF the application requires authentication THEN the system SHALL support authenticated test scenarios
5. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL verify functionality across different viewport sizes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code and maintain quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports
2. WHEN coverage is below threshold THEN the system SHALL fail the test run
3. WHEN viewing coverage reports THEN the system SHALL show line, branch, and function coverage
4. IF a file is excluded from coverage THEN the system SHALL respect coverage configuration
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL output coverage in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, text)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing utilities and helpers, so that I can write tests more efficiently with common patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL provide custom render functions for components with providers
2. WHEN testing forms THEN the system SHALL offer form testing utilities and validation helpers
3. WHEN mocking data THEN the system SHALL provide factory functions for test data generation
4. IF tests need setup/teardown THEN the system SHALL support test lifecycle management
5. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for handling promises and async state

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want continuous integration support, so that tests run automatically on code changes and pull requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to repository THEN the system SHALL automatically run the full test suite
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL run tests and report results
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merging and provide clear error messages
4. IF tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow the build process to continue
5. WHEN running in CI THEN the system SHALL optimize test execution for speed and reliability
