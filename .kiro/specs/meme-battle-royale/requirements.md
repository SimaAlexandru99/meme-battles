# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Meme Battle Royale system is a matchmaking-based multiplayer feature that allows players to join a queue and be automatically matched with other players for competitive meme battles. Unlike private lobbies where players invite specific friends, this system creates public matches by pairing players based on availability and skill level. The system must handle queue management, automatic lobby creation, player matching, and seamless transitions into gameplay while maintaining the same real-time performance standards as private lobbies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to join a Battle Royale queue with a single button click, so that I can quickly find and play with other players without needing invitation codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player clicks "Enter the arena" THEN the system SHALL add them to the matchmaking queue immediately
2. WHEN joining the queue THEN the system SHALL display a queue status interface showing estimated wait time and current position
3. WHEN in queue THEN the system SHALL show the number of players currently waiting for matches
4. WHEN in queue THEN the system SHALL allow the player to cancel and return to the main menu
5. WHEN joining the queue THEN the system SHALL validate the player is authenticated and has a complete profile
6. WHEN the player is already in a queue THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate queue entries
7. IF queue joining fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player in the matchmaking queue, I want to see real-time updates about my queue status and estimated wait time, so that I know how long until I'll be matched.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in the queue THEN the system SHALL display the current queue position in real-time
2. WHEN in the queue THEN the system SHALL show an estimated wait time based on recent matching patterns
3. WHEN in the queue THEN the system SHALL update the player count as others join or leave the queue
4. WHEN queue status changes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and animations
5. WHEN wait time exceeds 2 minutes THEN the system SHALL offer alternative options (create private lobby, play with AI)
6. WHEN the queue is very long THEN the system SHALL suggest peak hours or alternative game modes
7. IF queue data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL refresh automatically and show connection status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As the matchmaking system, I want to automatically create lobbies when sufficient players are queued, so that matches can begin without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 3 or more players are in queue THEN the system SHALL automatically create a new lobby and move players into it
2. WHEN creating a match THEN the system SHALL select players based on queue order (first-in-first-out)
3. WHEN creating a match THEN the system SHALL assign the first queued player as the temporary host
4. WHEN creating a match THEN the system SHALL set default game settings optimized for competitive play
5. WHEN a lobby is created THEN the system SHALL remove matched players from the queue immediately
6. WHEN lobby creation fails THEN the system SHALL return players to the queue and retry
7. WHEN fewer than 8 players are queued THEN the system SHALL create smaller lobbies (3-7 players)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be automatically matched with players of similar skill level when possible, so that games are competitive and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN matching players THEN the system SHALL consider player XP levels for balanced matches
2. WHEN matching players THEN the system SHALL prioritize connection quality and geographic proximity
3. WHEN sufficient players of similar skill are available THEN the system SHALL group them together
4. WHEN skill-based matching would cause excessive wait times THEN the system SHALL prioritize speed over perfect balance
5. WHEN a player has very high or low skill THEN the system SHALL expand the matching range gradually
6. WHEN creating matches THEN the system SHALL avoid pairing the same players repeatedly in short time periods
7. IF skill data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use random matching as fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to join existing Battle Royale lobbies that have space available, so that I can fill ongoing matches and reduce wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing lobbies have available slots THEN the system SHALL prioritize filling them over creating new lobbies
2. WHEN joining an existing lobby THEN the system SHALL verify the lobby is in "waiting" status (not started)

7. IF joining an existing lobby fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to creating a new lobby

### Requirement 6
