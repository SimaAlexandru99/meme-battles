# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for verifying and adjusting the current Meme Battles game implementation against the documented rules in README.md and Firebase configuration. The goal is to ensure the game mechanics, voting system, card distribution, and AI situation generation align with the intended design specifications and are properly configured in Firebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the current meme card distribution system, so that I can ensure players receive exactly 7 unique cards from the 800-image pool as specified in the README.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the current implementation THEN the system SHALL verify that players receive exactly 7 meme cards per hand
2. WHEN checking card distribution logic THEN the system SHALL ensure no duplicate cards exist within a single player's hand
3. WHEN reviewing the meme pool THEN the system SHALL confirm access to 800 images stored in `/public/memes/`
4. WHEN players use cards THEN the system SHALL replenish hands back to 7 cards after each round
5. WHEN multiple players are in a game THEN the system SHALL allow card overlap between different players' hands

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the voting system implementation, so that I can ensure it matches the simple one-vote-per-player system described in the README.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the voting logic THEN the system SHALL confirm each player can vote for only one meme per round
2. WHEN checking vote restrictions THEN the system SHALL ensure players cannot vote for their own submissions
3. WHEN reviewing winner determination THEN the system SHALL verify the meme with most votes wins the round
4. WHEN handling tie scenarios THEN the system SHALL implement the tie-breaking rule specified in README
5. WHEN awarding points THEN the system SHALL give points to players based on their submission's vote count

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the AI situation generation system, so that I can ensure it uses Vercel AI SDK as specified and generates appropriate prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining AI integration THEN the system SHALL confirm Vercel AI SDK is properly configured and used
2. WHEN checking situation generation THEN the system SHALL verify prompts are humorous and appropriate for meme matching
3. WHEN reviewing prompt variety THEN the system SHALL ensure diverse situations are generated each round
4. WHEN handling AI failures THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms for prompt generation
5. WHEN situations are displayed THEN the system SHALL present them clearly to all players simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify Firebase configuration and security rules, so that I can ensure proper data access and real-time synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining Firestore rules THEN the system SHALL verify appropriate read/write permissions for game data
2. WHEN checking authentication THEN the system SHALL confirm both Google OAuth and guest access work correctly
3. WHEN reviewing data structure THEN the system SHALL ensure it matches the schema outlined in README.md
4. WHEN testing real-time updates THEN the system SHALL verify game state synchronizes across all clients within 2 seconds
5. WHEN handling disconnections THEN the system SHALL implement proper reconnection and state recovery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the game flow and phase management, so that I can ensure rounds progress correctly from submission to voting to results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining game phases THEN the system SHALL verify proper transitions between submission, voting, and results phases
2. WHEN checking timers THEN the system SHALL confirm time limits match the settings specified in lobby configuration
3. WHEN reviewing round progression THEN the system SHALL ensure games progress through the correct number of rounds
4. WHEN handling phase transitions THEN the system SHALL automatically move between phases when conditions are met
5. WHEN games end THEN the system SHALL properly display final results and leaderboard

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the scoring system, so that I can ensure points are awarded correctly based on vote counts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining score calculation THEN the system SHALL verify points are awarded based on submission vote counts
2. WHEN checking score persistence THEN the system SHALL ensure scores are properly stored in Firebase
3. WHEN reviewing leaderboards THEN the system SHALL confirm accurate score tracking across rounds
4. WHEN handling score updates THEN the system SHALL synchronize score changes in real-time
5. WHEN games complete THEN the system SHALL properly calculate and display final rankings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the lobby and game settings system, so that I can ensure customizable game parameters work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining lobby settings THEN the system SHALL verify configurable parameters like rounds, time limits, and player counts
2. WHEN checking setting persistence THEN the system SHALL ensure lobby configurations are properly stored and applied
3. WHEN reviewing host controls THEN the system SHALL confirm only hosts can modify game settings
4. WHEN settings change THEN the system SHALL update all connected clients with new parameters
5. WHEN games start THEN the system SHALL apply the configured settings to the game session

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the chat and social features, so that I can ensure real-time communication works as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining chat functionality THEN the system SHALL verify messages are sent and received in real-time
2. WHEN checking message display THEN the system SHALL ensure proper formatting with player names and timestamps
3. WHEN reviewing chat moderation THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate content filtering if specified
4. WHEN handling chat history THEN the system SHALL maintain message history during game sessions
5. WHEN players disconnect THEN the system SHALL handle chat state appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify mobile responsiveness and accessibility, so that I can ensure the game works well on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL verify all game components are properly responsive
2. WHEN checking touch interactions THEN the system SHALL ensure card selection and voting work on touch screens
3. WHEN reviewing accessibility THEN the system SHALL confirm proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
4. WHEN testing different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt layouts appropriately
5. WHEN using assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL provide proper screen reader support

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and document any discrepancies, so that I can create an action plan to align the implementation with the documented specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing implementation to README THEN the system SHALL document all discrepancies found
2. WHEN analyzing Firebase configuration THEN the system SHALL identify any missing or incorrect settings
3. WHEN reviewing game mechanics THEN the system SHALL note any deviations from specified rules
4. WHEN examining feature completeness THEN the system SHALL list any missing functionality
5. WHEN creating action items THEN the system SHALL prioritize fixes based on impact and complexity
