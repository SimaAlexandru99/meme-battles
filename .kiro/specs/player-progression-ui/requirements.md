# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the user interface components for the Player Progression Systems in Meme Battles. While the backend logic for Skill Rating, XP, and Achievements is fully implemented and functional, the user-facing components need significant enhancement to provide players with clear feedback on their progress, achievements, and skill development. This feature will transform the existing backend systems into engaging, visible progression mechanics that enhance player retention and motivation.
