# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces AI players to the Meme Battles game lobby system to enhance the multiplayer experience. AI players will automatically join lobbies when needed, participate in gameplay by selecting memes and voting, and provide a consistent gaming experience even when there aren't enough human players available. The AI players will use the Vercel AI SDK to make contextually appropriate meme selections and voting decisions, ensuring engaging gameplay while maintaining the competitive and humorous nature of the game.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want AI players to automatically join my lobby when there aren't enough human players, so that I can start playing without waiting for more people to join.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lobby has fewer than the minimum required players AND the lobby creator enables AI players THEN the system SHALL automatically add AI players to reach the minimum player count
2. WHEN AI players are added to a lobby THEN they SHALL be clearly identified as AI players with distinct visual indicators (e.g., bot icon, different name styling)
3. WHEN a human player joins a lobby with AI players THEN an AI player SHALL be automatically removed to maintain the optimal player count
4. IF the lobby is set to private mode THEN AI players SHALL only be added if explicitly enabled by the lobby creator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a lobby creator, I want to control whether AI players can join my lobby, so that I can choose between waiting for human players or playing with AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a lobby THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle option to enable/disable AI players
2. WHEN AI players are enabled THEN the lobby creator SHALL be able to set the maximum number of AI players allowed (1-6)
3. WHEN AI players are disabled THEN the system SHALL NOT add any AI players regardless of current player count
4. WHEN lobby settings are changed THEN existing AI players SHALL be added or removed according to the new settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want AI players to participate meaningfully in the game, so that the gameplay remains engaging and competitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's an AI player's turn to submit a meme THEN the AI SHALL analyze the situation prompt and select an appropriate meme from their hand within 15-30 seconds
2. WHEN voting begins THEN AI players SHALL vote for submissions based on humor relevance and appropriateness, excluding their own submission
3. WHEN an AI player wins a round THEN they SHALL receive points and be included in the leaderboard like human players
4. WHEN an AI player is in the lobby chat THEN they SHALL occasionally send contextually appropriate messages or reactions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want AI players to have distinct personalities and behaviors, so that each AI feels unique and adds variety to the gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI players are created THEN each SHALL have a unique name, avatar, and personality profile (e.g., "Sarcastic Sam", "Wholesome Wendy")
2. WHEN an AI player makes decisions THEN their choices SHALL reflect their personality traits (e.g., sarcastic AI prefers edgy memes, wholesome AI prefers family-friendly content)
3. WHEN AI players interact in chat THEN their messages SHALL match their personality and use appropriate tone/language
4. WHEN multiple AI players are in the same lobby THEN they SHALL have different personalities to create variety

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want AI players to behave realistically in terms of timing and decision-making, so that the game flow feels natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI player needs to make a decision THEN they SHALL take a realistic amount of time (5-30 seconds) rather than responding instantly
2. WHEN an AI player is "thinking" THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators or status messages
3. WHEN an AI player submits a meme THEN they SHALL occasionally add a brief comment explaining their choice
4. WHEN game rounds progress THEN AI players SHALL maintain consistent engagement levels throughout the entire game

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want AI player behavior to be configurable and monitorable, so that I can optimize the AI experience and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI players are active THEN the system SHALL log their decision-making process and performance metrics
2. WHEN AI behavior needs adjustment THEN administrators SHALL be able to modify personality traits, response times, and decision algorithms
