# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes the foundational Firebase configuration for the Meme Battles application, enabling authentication (Google OAuth and guest access), real-time database functionality through Firestore, and file storage capabilities. This configuration will serve as the backbone for user management, game state persistence, and media handling throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Firebase services properly configured and initialized, so that the application can handle authentication, data storage, and file uploads reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Firebase SHALL be initialized with proper configuration for both client and server environments
2. WHEN Firebase initialization occurs THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
3. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variables are required
4. WHEN Firebase is initialized THEN Auth, Firestore, and Storage services SHALL be available for use throughout the application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my Google account, so that I can have a persistent identity across game sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Sign in with Google" THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google OAuth flow
2. WHEN Google authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create or retrieve the user's Firebase profile
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN the user SHALL be redirected back to the application with authenticated state
4. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN their profile information SHALL be accessible throughout the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to play as a guest without creating an account, so that I can quickly join games without commitment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Play as Guest" THEN the system SHALL create an anonymous Firebase authentication session
2. WHEN guest authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL generate a random display name for the user
3. WHEN a guest user joins a game THEN their temporary identity SHALL persist for the duration of the session
4. WHEN the browser session ends THEN guest authentication SHALL expire and not persist
5. WHEN a guest user wants to convert to a permanent account THEN the system SHALL provide an upgrade path

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Firestore configured for real-time data synchronization, so that game state can be shared between players instantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firestore is initialized THEN the database SHALL be configured with appropriate security rules
2. WHEN real-time listeners are established THEN changes SHALL propagate to all connected clients within 1 second
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. WHEN offline mode is detected THEN Firestore SHALL cache data locally and sync when connection is restored
5. WHEN security rules are applied THEN users SHALL only access data they are authorized to view or modify

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and share meme images, so that I can participate in meme battles with custom content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase Storage is initialized THEN file upload capabilities SHALL be available
2. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL validate file type and size constraints
3. WHEN file upload succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a secure, accessible URL for the uploaded file
4. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error feedback to the user
5. WHEN files are stored THEN they SHALL be organized in a logical folder structure by user and game session
