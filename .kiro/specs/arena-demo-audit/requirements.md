# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive audit of the `components/arena-demo.tsx` component and its related components to ensure they follow Next.js 15 and shadcn/ui best practices. The audit will identify areas for improvement in code quality, performance, accessibility, and adherence to modern React patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the arena-demo component to follow Next.js 15 best practices, so that the application is performant, maintainable, and follows modern React patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the component THEN the system SHALL identify any violations of Next.js 15 App Router patterns
2. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL verify proper use of client/server component boundaries
3. WHEN examining state management THEN the system SHALL ensure optimal use of React hooks and state patterns
4. WHEN checking performance THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for optimization using React 18+ features
5. IF the component uses deprecated patterns THEN the system SHALL flag them for modernization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the arena-demo component to properly implement shadcn/ui components, so that the UI is consistent and follows design system guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing UI components THEN the system SHALL verify proper shadcn/ui component usage
2. WHEN analyzing styling THEN the system SHALL ensure Tailwind CSS classes follow shadcn/ui conventions
3. WHEN checking component composition THEN the system SHALL validate proper use of Radix UI primitives
4. WHEN examining theming THEN the system SHALL verify CSS variables and theme integration
5. IF custom styling overrides shadcn/ui defaults THEN the system SHALL evaluate if they're necessary and properly implemented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the arena-demo component to be fully accessible, so that all users can interact with the game interface effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL verify proper ARIA labels and roles
2. WHEN analyzing keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
3. WHEN checking focus management THEN the system SHALL validate proper focus indicators and trap patterns
4. WHEN examining semantic HTML THEN the system SHALL ensure proper heading hierarchy and landmark usage
5. IF accessibility issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the arena-demo component to follow TypeScript best practices, so that the code is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing type definitions THEN the system SHALL verify proper TypeScript usage
2. WHEN analyzing props and interfaces THEN the system SHALL ensure comprehensive type coverage
3. WHEN checking type imports THEN the system SHALL validate proper import/export patterns
4. WHEN examining generic usage THEN the system SHALL ensure appropriate type constraints
5. IF type safety issues are found THEN the system SHALL recommend specific improvements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the arena-demo component dependencies to be audited, so that all related components follow the same best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying component dependencies THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive list of related components
2. WHEN analyzing each dependency THEN the system SHALL apply the same audit criteria
3. WHEN reviewing component relationships THEN the system SHALL identify coupling and cohesion issues
4. WHEN examining shared utilities THEN the system SHALL verify proper abstraction patterns
5. IF dependency issues are found THEN the system SHALL recommend architectural improvements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a prioritized action plan from the audit, so that I can systematically improve the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a prioritized list of issues
2. WHEN categorizing issues THEN the system SHALL group them by severity and impact
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL include specific code examples
4. WHEN estimating effort THEN the system SHALL indicate complexity level for each fix
5. IF breaking changes are required THEN the system SHALL clearly identify them and provide migration guidance
